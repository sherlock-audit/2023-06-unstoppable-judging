# Oracle data feed is insufficiently validated

## Summary
The price from the oracle can be stale and can lead to wrong return values due to not enough validations performed to the obtained data.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `Vault` contract, the Chainlink's price feed oracles are being used to get the current USD prices of different used tokens. To avoid stale values, some verifications are being done but not enough.

As per the official Chainlink recommendations, the code should also check that the `answer`'s value is greater than 0, the `answered_in_round` is greater or equal to the `round_id` var and finally that the `updated_at` var is greater than 0.

The current code is only checking the freshness of the answer (so it would be equivalent to the third check I mention) but it is also important to perform the other two checks to avoid stale data.

## Impact
This issue could lead to wrong price values, which in this case could lead to users' funds loses, liquidations and bad debt.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the other two checks, maybe something like this:
```vyper
round_id, answer, started_at, updated_at, answered_in_round = ChainlinkOracle(
        self.to_usd_oracle[_token]
    ).latestRoundData()

+    assert answer> 0, "invalid oracle answer"
+    assert answered_in_round >= round_id, "stale price"
+    assert updated_at > 0, "round not complete"
     assert (block.timestamp - updated_at) < ORACLE_FRESHNESS_THRESHOLD, "oracle not fresh"
```
