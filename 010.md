# Positions are not being liquidated when they should

## Summary
Positions are not being liquidated when they should

## Vulnerability Detail
Positions are being liquidated in the `liquidate` function:

as you can see, the position can only be liquidated if it is not liquidable:

The problem is that the total `total_debt_shares[_debt_token]` is not updated when checking whether the positon is liquidable neither when calling `liquidate`  You can see on the following links the progression of the function calls to calculate whether a position is liquidable or not:

As seen, `total_debt_shares[_debt_token]` is not updated to the current `total_debt_shares[_debt_token]` by calling `_update_debt` and therefore a stale `total_debt_shares[_debt_token]` is used to calculate whether a position is liquidable. Not accounting for positions that are in fact liquidable because the debt is not yet updated.

## Impact
Not updating the debt before liquidating a position will cause that positions that are in fact below the liquidation threshold, not be liquidated until debt is updated

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Call `_update_debt` at the beginning of the `liquidate` function
