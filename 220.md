# Not calling approve(0) before setting a new approval causes the call to revert when used with Tether (USDT)

## Summary
 Not calling approve(0) before setting a new approval causes the call to revert when used with Tether (USDT)
## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens do not implement the ERC20 standard properly but are still accepted by most code that accepts ERC20 tokens. For example Tether (USDT)'s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.


## Impact
Transactions will revert when using tokens like USDT

## Code Snippet
```vyper
@external
def swap(
    _token_in: address,
    _token_out: address,
    _amount_in: uint256,
    _min_amount_out: uint256,
) -> uint256:
    ERC20(_token_in).transferFrom(msg.sender, self, _amount_in)
    ERC20(_token_in).approve(UNISWAP_ROUTER, _amount_in)

    if self.direct_route[_token_in][_token_out] != 0:
        return self._direct_swap(_token_in, _token_out, _amount_in, _min_amount_out)
    else:
        return self._multi_hop_swap(_token_in, _token_out, _amount_in, _min_amount_out)

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To change the approved amount you first have to reduce the addresses allowance to zero
