# Users trying to reduce their positions with market orders will always revert

## Summary
Reducing the users' positions with market orders will always revert due to a wrong value assigned to the `min_amount_out` variable when swapping part of the funds out.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `Vault` contract, there is the `reduce_position` function, which is called by the users to reduce their positions. When the function is called, the `min_amount_out` variable used by UniswapV3 as a slippage protection is calculated with the following code:
```vyper
min_amount_out: uint256 = _min_amount_out
if min_amount_out == 0:
   # market order, add some slippage protection
   min_amount_out = self._market_order_min_amount_out(
       position.position_token, position.debt_token, position.position_amount
   )
```
When the function receives a `min_amount_out` equal to 0, it means the user wants to reduce the position with a market order (for example, to reduce it right now). But in that case, some slippage is calculated to bring some protection to the swap. That protection is calculated with the function `_market_order_min_amount_out` which basically does the following:
```vyper
return (
        self._quote_token_to_token(_token_in, _token_out, _amount_in)
        * (PERCENTAGE_BASE - self.liquidate_slippage[_token_in][_token_out])
        / PERCENTAGE_BASE
    )
```
The important part (for us) in that code is the call to `_quote_token_to_token`, which basically queries the price relation of both tokens and multiply it by the `_amount_in` var. But... if we check the original function (the one I wrote at the beginning of this section), the value passed as `_amount_in` to `_market_order_min_amount_out` is the `position_amount` value instead of the amount of the position to be reduced (contained in the var `_reduce_by_amount`).

And since in the `_swap` function we are swapping only the `_reduce_by_amount` amount and `position_amount` is always greater than `_reduce_by_amount`, the `_min_amount_out` value that we send in the `_swap` function will be always greater than the greatest amount out we could receive, making the `_swap` function to always revert thus making the `reduce_position` to revert also.

## Impact
Users won't be able to reduce their positions using market orders, potentially making them to lose funds due to not being able to reduce their positions in the right moment (since they should use non-market orders, which may not be right thing for their situation).

## Recommendation
Change the code like this:
```vyper
if min_amount_out == 0:
   # market order, add some slippage protection
   min_amount_out = self._market_order_min_amount_out(
-       position.position_token, position.debt_token, position.position_amount
+       position.position_token, position.debt_token, _reduce_by_amount
   )
```
