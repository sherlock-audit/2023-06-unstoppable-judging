# The reduced margin doesn't return to the trader in `Vault.reduce_position`.

## Summary

When executing `Vault.reduce_position`, the position tokens are sold. The debt and the margin  are reduced. However, the reduced margin doesn’t return to the trader, leading to a loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Vault.reduce_position` decreases position.margin_amount, but it doesn’t return the reduced margin to the trader.

```vyper
def reduce_position(
    _position_uid: bytes32, _reduce_by_amount: uint256, _min_amount_out: uint256
) -> uint256:
    …

    position.margin_amount -= reduce_margin_by_amount

    …
```
This reduced margin should go back to the trader.
```vyper
self.margin[position.account][position.debt_token] += reduce_margin_by_amount
```


## Impact

The reduced margin doesn’t return to the trader, leading to a loss of funds.
