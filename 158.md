# Some Token's like `USDT` do not have a return value on `transfer`.

## Summary
Some tokens do not implement the `ERC20` standard properly but are still accepted by most code that accepts `ERC20` tokens. For example, `Tether` (`USDT`)'s transfer() and transferFrom() functions on L1 do not return booleans as the specification requires and instead have `no return value`.
**Note** ----> This report is different from my previous report that had to do with `unchecked return value` ___Here I'm tackling the fact that some `ERC20 tokens` that are widely used do not have return values, and they are not tackled properly in the protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
This is an instance.
```vyper
       ERC20(_token_in).transferFrom(msg.sender, self, _amount_in)
```
## Impact
where the return values are not known failed transfer's will fail silently.
## Code Snippet
> **These lines are all the instances of the bug in the protocol.**
