# Stuck funds in the vault duo to wrong logic applied when adding margin to a position.

## Summary
Stuck funds in the vault duo to wrong logic applied when adding margin to a position. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The function add_margin is used by user to reduce the leverage of the position, by adding margin to it. 

By using the function, the position's margin amount is updated with the new amount added, so that the position's leverage doesn't exceed the max leverage allowed and the function isn't eligible for liquidation. 

Once added this margin can't be removed from the position if it gets the position back in liquidation state.

```vy
@external
def add_margin(_position_uid: bytes32, _amount: uint256):
    """
    @notice
        Allows to add additional margin to a Position and 
        reduce the leverage.
    """
    assert self.is_whitelisted_dex[msg.sender], "unauthorized"

    position: Position = self.positions[_position_uid]

    assert (self.margin[position.account][position.debt_token] >= _amount), "not enough margin"

    self.margin[position.account][position.debt_token] -= _amount
    position.margin_amount += _amount

    self.positions[_position_uid] = position
    log MarginAdded(_position_uid, _amount)
```
```vy
@external
def remove_margin(_position_uid: bytes32, _amount: uint256):
    """
    @notice
        Allows to remove margin from a Position and 
        increase the leverage.
    """
    assert self.is_whitelisted_dex[msg.sender], "unauthorized"

    position: Position = self.positions[_position_uid]

    assert position.margin_amount >= _amount, "not enough margin"

    position.margin_amount -= _amount
    self.margin[position.account][position.debt_token] += _amount

    assert not self._is_liquidatable(_position_uid), "exceeds max leverage"
    
    self.positions[_position_uid] = position
    log MarginRemoved(_position_uid, _amount)
```

The only choice would be to close or partially close the position.

But if we look over the function we can see that the margin amount isn't accounted anywhere.

Fully closing the position: Even tho margin was added the position_amount stays the same, so the function doesn't count it and still process the closing with the old values. At the end the extra margin added is being deleted with the position, which means that the funds are stuck in the contract.

Partially closing the position: On the other hand partially closing counts the margin amount and calculates the debt ratio based on the new amount of margin, but still do the closing based on the old leverage before the extra margin was added. Which leads to the same stuck funds in the contract as fully closing the position.

The conclusion is that adding margin to the position can reduce the leverage of the position, so the position is not eligible for liquidation, but closing the position is still based on the old leverage before the extra margin was added to the position. In the end when closing the positions, these extra funds added to the position are not included anywhere   and are stuck in the contract.

## Impact
Duo to the wrong logic applied, this issue leads to permanent loss of funds as the funds are stuck in the vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adding margin should not only update the position's margin but update whole position amount by doing a swap with the extra margin provided.

```vy
@external
def add_margin(_position_uid: bytes32, _amount: uint256, _min_position_amount_out: uint256):
    """
    @notice
        Allows to add additional margin to a Position and 
        reduce the leverage.
    """
    assert self.is_whitelisted_dex[msg.sender], "unauthorized"

    position: Position = self.positions[_position_uid]

    assert (self.margin[position.account][position.debt_token] >= _amount), "not enough margin"

    self.margin[position.account][position.debt_token] -= _amount

    amount_bought: uint256 = self._swap(
        _debt_token, _position_token, _amount, _min_position_amount_out
    )

    position.margin_amount += _amount
    position.position_amount += _amount

    fee: uint256 = _amount * self.trade_open_fee / PERCENTAGE_BASE
    assert self.margin[_account][_debt_token] >= fee, "not enough margin for fee"
    self.margin[_account][_debt_token] -= fee
    self._distribute_trading_fee(_debt_token, fee)

    self.positions[_position_uid] = position
