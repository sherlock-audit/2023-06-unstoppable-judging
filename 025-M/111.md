# `MarginDex::execute_limit_order` will always revert

## Summary
All calls to the `MarginDex`'s `execute_limit_order` will always revert due the limit order being cleared in storage ahead of a call to `remove_limit_order`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `execute_limit_order` function includes the following logic...

```vyper
    self.limit_orders[_uid] = empty(LimitOrder)
    
    trade: Trade = self._open_trade(
        limit_order.account,
        limit_order.position_token,
        limit_order.min_position_amount_out,
        limit_order.debt_token,
        limit_order.debt_amount,
        limit_order.margin_amount,
        limit_order.tp_orders,
        limit_order.sl_orders
    )

    self._remove_limit_order(_uid)
```

The limit order is being set to `empty(LimitOrder)` in storage. Then a call to `self._remove_limit_order` is called for the same `_uid`.

`_remove_limit_order` has the following logic...

```vyper
    order: LimitOrder = self.limit_orders[_uid]
    self.limit_orders[_uid] = empty(LimitOrder)

    uids: DynArray[bytes32, 1024] = self.limit_order_uids[order.account]
    for i in range(1024):
        if uids[i] == _uid:
            uids[i] = uids[len(uids) - 1]
            uids.pop()
            break
        if i == len(uids) - 1: // @audit - Reverts when uids is empty
            raise
    self.limit_order_uids[order.account] = uids
```

The newly-empty order is read from storage, and it's associated `account` is used fetch the `limit_order_uids`. 

The issue is that this account is the zero address, which is the default value after the order was cleared in the preceding function. This will cause the `uids` array to be empty, and the loop will revert when `i == len(uids) - 1`.

## Impact
This means that all calls to `execute_limit_order` will revert, and no limit orders can be executed, which is a major piece of functionality for the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`execute_limit_order` should not clear the limit order in storage before calling `remove_limit_order`. This will allow the `limit_order_uids` to be fetched correctly.
