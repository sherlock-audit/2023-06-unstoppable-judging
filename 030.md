# Oracle price does not check if L2 sequencer is down

## Summary

Unstoppable will deploy on L2 Arbitrum, chainlink oracle may return stale price when L2 sequencer is down.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the audit description, unstoppable will be deployed on L2 Arbitrum.
From [Chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds), If a sequencer becomes unavailable, ChainlinkAggregator may return stale price.
Arbitrum recently experienced just such an [incident](https://twitter.com/ArbitrumDevs/status/1667333516441403393)

Note that It is a different issue from checking oracle price freshness.
Because in the case of sharp price fluctuations, the price may be updated several times, although the final price is in freshness, but it may not be the latest price.

## Impact

`_get_latest_oracle_price` returns stale `current_price`, if L2 sequencer is down and `current_price` is not updated, searchers can utilize `stale current_price < trigger_price` to execute order, but the `actual price >= trigger_price`.
