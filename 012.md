# Liquidations will not be able to be executed if user has a very small margin and the amount_out_received from closing a position is greater than the debt_amount

## Summary
Liquidations will not be able to be executed if user has a very small margin and the `amount_out_received` from closing a position is greater than the `debt_amount`

## Vulnerability Detail

To liquidate positions, the `liquidate` function has to be called. Essentially what it does is to close the position in the first place.

After closing the position, if the swapped amount was higher than the debt from that position, a penalty is charged to the account that opened the position in the first place.

If a trader opens a position with all its available margin, so he stays will 0 margin in his balance, and when the position is liquidated the amount swapped is bigger than the debt, charging the penalty will fail if `penalty` is bigger than the `trader_pnl` added when closing the position.

```solidity
penalty: uint256 = debt_amount * self.liquidation_penalty / PERCENTAGE_BASE

trader_pnl: uint256 = amount_out_received - position_debt_amount
```


Because trader has less balance on margin that the penalty charged to his account the transaction would revert due to underflow. Therefore, traders have a pretty high change of creating un-liquidable positions while the swap when closing a position is larger than the debt:

## Impact
Positions will be un-liquidable when created with all the available margin and having a positive swap when closing the position.
