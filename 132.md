# Executes swaps without slippage protection

## Summary
Executes swaps without slippage protection
## Vulnerability Detail
In the direct_swap() function in SwapRouter.vy, sqrtPriceLimitX96 is set to 0. There is no price limit set, and the trade will execute at any price range.

## Impact
Incorrect slippage application can result in partial swaps and loss of funds.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
def _direct_swap(
    _token_in: address,
    _token_out: address,
    _amount_in: uint256,
    _min_amount_out: uint256,
) -> uint256:
    fee: uint24 = self.direct_route[_token_in][_token_out]
    assert fee != 0, "no direct route"

    params: ExactInputSingleParams = ExactInputSingleParams(
        {
            tokenIn: _token_in,
            tokenOut: _token_out,
            fee: fee,
            recipient: msg.sender,
            deadline: block.timestamp,
            amountIn: _amount_in,
            amountOutMinimum: _min_amount_out,
            sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0,
        }
    )
    return UniswapV3SwapRouter(UNISWAP_ROUTER).exactInputSingle(params)
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Need to set price limit for swap, because every swap has impact on price and this change in price will change use case and effect so by sqrtPriceLimitX96, we can limit the swap.
