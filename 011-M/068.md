# Wrong accounting of the storage balances results for the protocol to be in debt even when the bad debt is repaid.

## Summary
Wrong accounting of the storage balances results for the protocol to be in debt even when the bad debt is repaid.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a position is fully closed, it can result to accruing bad debt or being in profit and repaying the borrowed liquidity which all depends on the amount_out_received from the swap.

In a bad debt scenario the function calculates the bad debt and accrues it based on the difference between the position debt and the amount out received from the swap. And after that repays the liquidity providers with the same received amount from the swap.

```vy
    if amount_out_received >= position_debt_amount:
        # all good, LPs are paid back, remainder goes back to trader
        trader_pnl: uint256 = amount_out_received - position_debt_amount
        self.margin[position.account][position.debt_token] += trader_pnl
        self._repay(position.debt_token, position_debt_amount)
    else:
        # edge case: bad debt
        self.is_accepting_new_orders = False  # put protocol in defensive mode
        bad_debt: uint256 = position_debt_amount - amount_out_received
        self.bad_debt[position.debt_token] += bad_debt
        self._repay(
            position.debt_token, amount_out_received
        )  # repay LPs as much as possible
        log BadDebt(position.debt_token, bad_debt, position.uid)
```

The mapping total_debt_amount holds all debt borrowed from users, and this amount accrues interest with the time.

Prior to closing a position, the bad debt is calculated and accrued to the mapping bad_debt, but it isn't subtracted from the mapping total_debt_amount which holds all the debt even the bad one accrued through the time. 

```vy
@internal
def _update_debt(_debt_token: address):
    """
    @notice
        Accounts for any accrued interest since the last update.
    """
    if block.timestamp == self.last_debt_update[_debt_token]:
        return  # already up to date, nothing to do

    self.last_debt_update[_debt_token] = block.timestamp
    
    if self.total_debt_amount[_debt_token] == 0:
        return # no debt, no interest

    self.total_debt_amount[_debt_token] += self._debt_interest_since_last_update(
        _debt_token
    )
```

As the bad debt isn't subtracted from the total_debt_amount when closing a position, even after repaying the bad debt. It will still be in the total_debt_amount, which will prevent the full withdrawing of the liquidity funds.
```vy
@nonreentrant("lock")
@external
def repay_bad_debt(_token: address, _amount: uint256):
    """
    @notice
        Allows to repay bad_debt in case it was accrued.
    """
    self.bad_debt[_token] -= _amount
    self._safe_transfer_from(_token, msg.sender, self, _amount)
```
```vy
@internal
@view
def _available_liquidity(_token: address) -> uint256:
    return self._total_liquidity(_token) - self.total_debt_amount[_token]
```
```vy
@internal
@view
def _total_liquidity(_token: address) -> uint256:
    return (
        self.base_lp_total_amount[_token]
        + self.safety_module_lp_total_amount[_token]
        - self.bad_debt[_token]
    )
```

## Impact
The issue leads to liquidity providers unable to withdraw their full amount of funds, as even after repaying the bad debt it will still be in the total_debt_amount mapping.

## Recommendation
The only way to fix this problem is to repay the position debt amount prior to closing a position and not only the received amount from the swap. Because total_debt_amount holds the bad debt as well.

```vy
    else:
        # edge case: bad debt
        self.is_accepting_new_orders = False  # put protocol in defensive mode
        bad_debt: uint256 = position_debt_amount - amount_out_received
        self.bad_debt[position.debt_token] += bad_debt
        self._repay(
            position.debt_token, position_debt_amount
        )  # repay LPs as much as possible
        log BadDebt(position.debt_token, bad_debt, position.uid)

```
