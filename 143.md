# `reduce_position` doesnâ€™t update margin mapping correctly

## Summary
`reduce_position` function decrease the margin amount of the position but doesn't add it back to the user's margin mapping, making it impossible to withdraw the margin.

## Vulnerability Detail
After selling some position tokens back against debt tokens using `reduce_position` function, `debt_shares` and `margin_amount` are reduced proportionally to keep leverage the same as before:

[Vault.vy#L313-L330](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-unstoppable/blob/main/unstoppable-dex-audit/contracts/margin-dex/Vault.vy#L313-L330)
```solidity
debt_amount: uint256 = self._debt(_position_uid)
    margin_debt_ratio: uint256 = position.margin_amount * PRECISION / debt_amount


    amount_out_received: uint256 = self._swap(
        position.position_token, position.debt_token, _reduce_by_amount, min_amount_out
    )


    # reduce margin and debt, keep leverage as before
    reduce_margin_by_amount: uint256 = (
        amount_out_received * margin_debt_ratio / PRECISION
    )
    reduce_debt_by_amount: uint256 = amount_out_received - reduce_margin_by_amount


    position.margin_amount -= reduce_margin_by_amount


    burnt_debt_shares: uint256 = self._repay(position.debt_token, reduce_debt_by_amount)
    position.debt_shares -= burnt_debt_shares
    position.position_amount -= _reduce_by_amount
```

However, even though some of the margin have been paid back (`position.margin_amount` has been reduced), `self.margin[position.account][position.debt_token]` mapping hasn't been updated by adding `reduce_margin_by_amount` which would allow the user to withdraw his margin.

## Impact
Users will lose their margin tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider modifying the code like this:

```solidity
    reduce_debt_by_amount: uint256 = amount_out_received - reduce_margin_by_amount


    position.margin_amount -= reduce_margin_by_amount
+   self.margin[position.account][position.debt_token] += reduce_margin_by_amount

    burnt_debt_shares: uint256 = self._repay(position.debt_token, reduce_debt_by_amount)
    position.debt_shares -= burnt_debt_shares
    position.position_amount -= _reduce_by_amount
```
