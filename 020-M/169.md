# Vault: `_update_debt` should be called in the entry of close_position, reduce_position and liquidate

## Summary

In functions like `close_position`, `reduce_position` and `liquidate`, `_update_debt` should be called first to accure debt interest for `_debt(_position_uid)` function to return the correct debt.

## Vulnerability Detail

`close_position`, `reduce_position` and `liquidate` all calls `_debt(_position_uid)` to get debt amount, but if `_update_debt` is not called beforehand, the interest is not added so the debt is incorrect.

## Impact

Debt amount will less than real.
