# Hardcoded slippage will make orders to be stuck in specific market conditions

## Summary
Hardcoded slippage will make orders to be stuck in specific market conditions

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently the calculation of the slippage for swapping, uses a constant named `liquidate_slippage` , which is a value choosen by the owner. This slippage will be used for the calculation in every swap that needs of unstoppables's calculation, in any market condition. Therefore, it is the same to say that the slippage is calculated using a hardcoded parameter.
