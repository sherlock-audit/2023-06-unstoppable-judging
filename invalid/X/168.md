# DCA order can be cancelled even when the token transfers have not been successfully completed

## Summary
The cancel_dca_order Function cancels a DCA order without verifying if the token transfers are successful
## Vulnerability Detail
In the cancel_dca_order function, it first retrieves the DCA order associated with the given _uid. Then, it checks if the message sender (caller) is the same as the owner of the DCA order. If the caller is the owner, it calls the internal function _cancel_dca_order to perform the cancellation process.
The vulnerability arises from the fact that the _cancel_dca_order function doesn't include any token transfer checks. The _cancel_dca_order function calls another internal function _cleanup_order, which effectively removes the DCA order from the contract storage and updates the user's list of DCA orders. However, it doesn't revert or handle any potential token transfer failures.
## Impact
if the DCA order involves token transfers fail some reason, the user may not receive their tokens back as expected leading to loss of funds

Make sure to also include the _safe_transfer function in the contract, as it is used for token transfers and error handling:
