# Lowering the max leverage for a market will unfairly result in liquidated positions

## Summary

The `Vault` contract allows the admin to adjust the max leverage allowed for markets through the `set_max_leverage_for_market` function.

The issue is that reducing the max leverage for a market will invalidate protective stop loss orders and potentially make positions immediately vulnerable to liquidations.

## Vulnerability Detail

For traders to be able to protect their positions from liquidations, they are able to place take-profit and stop-loss orders. But to do so, they need assurances that the max leverage allowed for a market will not be reduced, otherwise their orders will be invalidated and their positions will be vulnerable to liquidations.

## Impact

Reducing the max leverage for a market will invalidate protective stop loss orders and potentially make positions immediately vulnerable to liquidations.

The protocol should not allow for this.
