# MarginDex.open_trade() allows bad actors to drain all debt tokens

## Summary
By providing some margin, a bad actor could swap debt tokens to position tokens by opening a position with `open_trade()`. However, the underlying `Vault.open_position()` fails to check if the *debt-to-position* swap is within a reasonable price range, leading to possible attacks to drain all debt tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `Vault.open_position()`, a whitelisted dex (e.g., MarginDex) can open a position with `_margin_amount` of debt token and leverage `_debt_token` of debt token. Later on, `_margin_amount + _debt_token` of debt tokens would be exchanged to position tokens. However, the [swap operation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-unstoppable/blob/main/unstoppable-dex-audit/contracts/margin-dex/Vault.vy#L182) fails to check the slippage (i.e., `_min_position_amount_out`) such that a bad actor could intentionally provide enough margin, leverage all debt tokens, and exchange them to position token with unlimited slippage (i.e., `_min_position_amount_out = 0`). By creating an UniswapV3 position in advance, those debt tokens would be exchanged to a tiny amount of position token (e.g., 1 wei of ETH) and the attacker can walk away with all debt tokens. 

## Impact
Bad actors can drain all debt tokens

## Recommendation
Check if the position is liquidatable before opening it
