# Relying on oracle base slippage parameters can cause significant loss due to sandwich attacks

## Summary
Swap relies on Oracle price data when determining the slippage parameter during a swap. This is problematic as chainlink oracles, especially main-net, have upwards of a 2% threshold before triggering a price update. If swapping between volatile assets, the errors will compound causing even bigger variations. These variations can be exploited via sandwich attacks.
## Vulnerability Detail
```vyper
def _quote_token_to_token(
    _token0: address, _token1: address, _amount0: uint256
) -> uint256:
    token0_in_usd: uint256 = self._in_usd(_token0, _amount0)  # 8 decimals
    token1_decimals: uint256 = convert(ERC20(_token1).decimals(), uint256)
    token1_usd_price: uint256 = self._to_usd_oracle_price(_token1)
```
In the _market_order_min_amount_out function.
```vyper
def _market_order_min_amount_out(
    _token_in: address, _token_out: address, _amount_in: uint256
) -> uint256:
    """
    @notice
        For market orders like during liquidation or for a StopLoss,
        we want a fairly wide slippage to ensure the swap is executed
        as quickly as possible, while at the same time protect against
        sandwhich attacks and frontrunning.
        Here we calculate a reasonable min_amount_out based on the 
        liquidate_slippage configured for the specific market.
    """
    return (
        self._quote_token_to_token(_token_in, _token_out, _amount_in)
        * (PERCENTAGE_BASE - self.liquidate_slippage[_token_in][_token_out])
        / PERCENTAGE_BASE
    )
```

When determining the minimum return from the swap, _market_order_min_amount_out directly uses Oracle data to determine the final output. The differences between the true value and the oracle value can be systematically exploited via sandwich attacks. Given the leveraged nature of the module, these losses can cause significant losses when swapping.
## Impact
oracle derived slippage parameters will lead to significant and unnecessary losses

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The solution to this is straightforward. Allow users to specify their own slippage value. Instead of using an oracle slippage parameter, validate that the specified slippage value is within a margin of the oracle. This gives the best of both worlds. It allows for tighter and more reactive slippage controls.
