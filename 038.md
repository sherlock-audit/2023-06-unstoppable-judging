# execute_trailing_stop_limit_order can never be used because oracle_addresses are empty

## Summary

In TrailingStopDex, there is no way to set oracle_addresses. So oracle is always at `address(0)` and cannot read the price.

## Vulnerability Detail

```vyper
    oracle_address: address = self.oracle_addresses[order.token_in]

    # get price at _proof_round_id
    proof_round_price: uint256 = 0
    proof_round_price_updated_at: uint256 = 0

    (proof_round_price, proof_round_price_updated_at) = self._get_price_at_round(oracle_address, _proof_round_id)
```

there is no way to set oracle_addresses, its always address(0).

## Impact

execute_trailing_stop_limit_order will always revert
