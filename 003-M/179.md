# Approve function can fail for non standard ERC20 tokens like USDT

## Summary
Approve function can fail for non standard ERC20 tokens like USDT

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example Tether (USDT)’s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals. [Link to usdt contract reference(SLOC 199-209)](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code)

approve is actually vulnerable to a sandwich attack as explained in the following document and this check for allowance doesn't actually avoid it.

In ERC20, front running attack is possible via approve() function,

In the protocol, all functions using approve() must be first approved by zero. The D3Callee() is called to make ERC20 approvals. But it does not approve 0 first.
```solidity
def swap(
    _token_in: address,
    _token_out: address,
    _amount_in: uint256,
    _min_amount_out: uint256,
) -> uint256:
    ERC20(_token_in).transferFrom(msg.sender, self, _amount_in)
    ERC20(_token_in).approve(UNISWAP_ROUTER, _amount_in)

    if self.direct_route[_token_in][_token_out] != 0:
        return self._direct_swap(_token_in, _token_out, _amount_in, _min_amount_out)
    else:
        return self._multi_hop_swap(_token_in, _token_out, _amount_in, _min_amount_out)
```
