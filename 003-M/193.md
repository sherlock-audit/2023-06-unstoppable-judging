# USDT: set allowance to be 0 first

## Summary
To approve tokens like USDT, set their allowance to 0 first and then approve with the intended amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens like USDT require that the allowance should be set to 0 first and then be set to the new value. This means if you’re only using `approve `and not resetting the `allowance`, you won’t be able to allow a different amount until the `allowance` is reset first.

## Impact
It won't be possible to use ERC20 tokens like USDT.
