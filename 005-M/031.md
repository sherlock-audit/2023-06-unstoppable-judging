# Chainlink aggregators return the minAnswer price if it's below minAnswer

## Summary

Chainlink aggregators have a built in circuit breaker if the price is below minAnswer, which will affect the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

```vyper
    proof_round_price: uint256 = 0
    proof_round_price_updated_at: uint256 = 0

    (proof_round_price, proof_round_price_updated_at) = self._get_price_at_round(oracle_address, _proof_round_id)

    # ensure proof_round was after order created
    assert proof_round_price_updated_at > order.created_at, "invalid proof: too old"

    # check current price
    current_price: uint256 = self._get_latest_oracle_price(oracle_address)

    # ensure current price < proof_round_price - trailing_percentage
    trigger_price: uint256 = proof_round_price * (100 - order.trailing_percentage) / 100 # TODO check
    assert current_price < trigger_price, "trigger price not reached"
```

For `trigger_price`, If actual price is below minAnswer: `actual price < current_price = trigger_price = minAnswer`, order can't be execute even if the actual price is less than the trigger price.

```vyper
@view
@internal
def _to_usd_oracle_price(_token: address) -> uint256:
    """
    @notice
        Retrieves the latest Chainlink oracle price for _token.
        Ensures that the Arbitrum sequencer is up and running and
        that the Chainlink feed is fresh.
    """
    assert self._sequencer_up(), "sequencer down"

    round_id: uint80 = 0
    answer: int256 = 0
    started_at: uint256 = 0
    updated_at: uint256 = 0
    answered_in_round: uint80 = 0
    round_id, answer, started_at, updated_at, answered_in_round = ChainlinkOracle(
        self.to_usd_oracle[_token]
    ).latestRoundData()

    assert (block.timestamp - updated_at) < ORACLE_FRESHNESS_THRESHOLD, "oracle not fresh"

    usd_price: uint256 = convert(answer, uint256)  # 8 dec
    return usd_price
```

For `_to_usd_oracle_price`, if it's below minAnswer, protocol will overestimate the price, affect liquidation and so on.

## Impact

When the price reaches below the minimum value, which will affect the order execute and liquidation.
