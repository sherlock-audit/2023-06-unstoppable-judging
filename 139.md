# Vault: 24h ORACLE_FRESHNESS_THRESHOLD is too long for oracle price freshness check

## Summary

In Vault.vy, latestRoundData() is called to query prices from chainlink. The price is freshness is checked, but the freshness threshold is set to 24h which is too large.

## Vulnerability Detail

latestRoundData() call and freshness check.

```python
    round_id: uint80 = 0
    answer: int256 = 0
    started_at: uint256 = 0
    updated_at: uint256 = 0
    answered_in_round: uint80 = 0
    round_id, answer, started_at, updated_at, answered_in_round = ChainlinkOracle(
        self.to_usd_oracle[_token]
    ).latestRoundData()

    assert (block.timestamp - updated_at) < ORACLE_FRESHNESS_THRESHOLD, "oracle not fresh"
```

`ORACLE_FRESHNESS_THRESHOLD` is hardcode code to 24h.

## Impact

A stale price could be used.
