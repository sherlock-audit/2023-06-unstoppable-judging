# Unsafe Casting Chainlinks price might return an insane big price

## Summary
Unsafe Casting Chainlinks price might return an insane big price

## Vulnerability Detail
Unstoppable are currently fetching price from chainlink in the following way:

```solidity
    round_id: uint80 = 0
    answer: int256 = 0
    started_at: uint256 = 0
    updated_at: uint256 = 0
    answered_in_round: uint80 = 0
    round_id, answer, started_at, updated_at, answered_in_round = ChainlinkOracle(
        self.to_usd_oracle[_token]
    ).latestRoundData()

    assert (block.timestamp - updated_at) < ORACLE_FRESHNESS_THRESHOLD, "oracle not fresh"
    usd_price: uint256 = convert(answer, uint256)  # 8 dec
    return usd_price
```

The problem with this implementation is that chainlink's `answer` parameter is returned as an `int` `answer: int256 ` because it can return negative in some cases.

The issue becomes when handling this `answer` after the call. As you can see `usd_price: uint256 = convert(answer, uint256)`  is directly casted from `int` to `uint` without even checking the value.
If chainlink returns a negative price, there will be an overflow and it will completely miss-price the asset.

## Impact
Loss of funds for the protocol if the `answer` overflows, allowing any MEV/user to take profit

## Recommendation
Do not cast the answer to `uint` without checking that it is not > 0 first
