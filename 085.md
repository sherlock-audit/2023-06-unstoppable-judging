# `reduce_margin_by_amount` in `Vault.reduce_position` is wrongly calculated

## Summary

In `Vault.reduce_position`, some position tokens are sold and debt and margin are reduced. The remaining amount of debt and margin should maintain the same leverage as before. However, the reduced amount is wrongly calculated and as a result, the leverage is changed.

## Vulnerability Detail

The calculation of reduced amount is implemented in `Vault.reduce_position`.

```vyper
def reduce_position(
    _position_uid: bytes32, _reduce_by_amount: uint256, _min_amount_out: uint256
) -> uint256:
    …

    debt_amount: uint256 = self._debt(_position_uid)
    margin_debt_ratio: uint256 = position.margin_amount * PRECISION / debt_amount

    amount_out_received: uint256 = self._swap(
        position.position_token, position.debt_token, _reduce_by_amount, min_amount_out
    )

    # reduce margin and debt, keep leverage as before
    reduce_margin_by_amount: uint256 = (
        amount_out_received * margin_debt_ratio / PRECISION
    )
    reduce_debt_by_amount: uint256 = amount_out_received - reduce_margin_by_amount

    position.margin_amount -= reduce_margin_by_amount

    burnt_debt_shares: uint256 = self._repay(position.debt_token, reduce_debt_by_amount)
    position.debt_shares -= burnt_debt_shares
    position.position_amount -= _reduce_by_amount

    …
```

Suppose that the debt amount is 9000 USDC and the margin amount is also 9000 USDC. And the amount_out_received is 9000 USDC. Let’s take a look of the calculation:
```vyper
//  margin_debt_ratio: uint256 = position.margin_amount * PRECISION / debt_amount
margin_debt_ration = 9000 * PRECISION / 9000 = PRECISION
//     reduce_margin_by_amount: uint256 = (
//        amount_out_received * margin_debt_ratio / PRECISION
//    )
reduce_margin_by_amount = 9000 * PRECISION / PRECISION = 9000
//  reduce_debt_by_amount: uint256 = amount_out_received - reduce_margin_by_amount
reduce_debt_by_amount = 9000 - 9000 = 0
// position.margin_amount -= reduce_margin_by_amount
 position.margin_amount = 9000
```

We can find out that the reduced amount of margin is 9000 and the reduced amount of debt is 0. The leverage is changed.

I also wrote a test to demonstrate the issue. (The test case is different from the previous case)
```python
def test_reduce_position(vault, owner, weth, usdc, mock_router, eth_usd_oracle):
    eth_usd_oracle.set_answer(9000_00000000)
    assert vault.swap_router() == mock_router.address

    uid, amount_bought = vault.open_position(
        owner,  # account
        weth,  # position_token
        2 * 10**18,  # min_position_amount_out
        usdc,  # debt_token
        9000 * 10**6,  # debt_amount
        9000 * 10**6,  # margin_amount
    )

    position_before = vault.positions(uid)
    position_amount_before = position_before[6]
    assert position_amount_before == 2 * 10**18

    margin_amount_before = position_before[3]
    assert margin_amount_before == 9000 * 10**6

    debt_amount_before = vault.debt(uid)
    assert debt_amount_before == 9000 * 10**6

    vault.reduce_position(uid, int(position_amount_before/3), 6000 * 10**6)

    position_after = vault.positions(uid)

    debt_amount_after = vault.debt_shares_to_amount(usdc.address, position_after[4])
    print(debt_amount_after)
    assert debt_amount_after == pytest.approx(6000 * 10**6, abs = 10000000) // @audit it would fail since debt_amount_after  is 9000 * 10**6

    margin_amount_after = position_after[3]
    print(margin_amount_after)
    assert margin_amount_after == pytest.approx(6000 * 10**6, abs = 1000000)

    position_amount_after = position_after[6]
```

Besides, I want to mention that the usage of `pytest.approx` is incorrect in `test_reduce_position`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-unstoppable/blob/main/unstoppable-dex-audit/tests/vault/test_reduce_position.py#L56
```python
    assert debt_amount_after == pytest.approx(6000 * 10**6, 10000000)
```
If the approximation means `6000 * 10 ** 6 ± 10000000`, it should be `pytest.approx(6000 * 10**6, abs=10000000)`. On the other hand, `pytest.approx(6000 * 10**6, 10000000)` considers numbers within a relative tolerance of the expected value. The approximation `6000 * 10 ** 6 ± (6000 * 10**6 * 10000000)` has too large of a range of values.


## Impact

The reduced amounts of debt and margin are wrongly calculated. The leverage is changed after `reduce_position`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The correct calculation should be:
```diff
def reduce_position(
    _position_uid: bytes32, _reduce_by_amount: uint256, _min_amount_out: uint256
) -> uint256:
    …
-   margin_debt_ratio: uint256 = position.margin_amount * PRECISION / debt_amount
+   margin_debt_ratio: uint256 = position.margin_amount * PRECISION / ( debt_amount + position.margin_amount)

    amount_out_received: uint256 = self._swap(
        position.position_token, position.debt_token, _reduce_by_amount, min_amount_out
    )

    # reduce margin and debt, keep leverage as before
    reduce_margin_by_amount: uint256 = (
        amount_out_received * margin_debt_ratio / PRECISION
    )
    reduce_debt_by_amount: uint256 = amount_out_received - reduce_margin_by_amount

    position.margin_amount -= reduce_margin_by_amount

    burnt_debt_shares: uint256 = self._repay(position.debt_token, reduce_debt_by_amount)
    position.debt_shares -= burnt_debt_shares
    position.position_amount -= _reduce_by_amount

    self.positions[_position_uid] = position

    log PositionReduced(position.account, _position_uid, position, amount_out_received)

    return amount_out_received
```
