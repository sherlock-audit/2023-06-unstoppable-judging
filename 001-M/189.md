# use `safeERC20` operations in `swap` function

## Summary
Use `safeTransferFrom` instead of `transferFrom` for ERC20 tokens in the`swap` function of `SwapRouter` contract. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `transferFrom` function returns a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

## Impact
Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer and hence token transfers could fail silently without reverting.
