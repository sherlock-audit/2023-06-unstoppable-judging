# In the Vault contract, the _update_debt_() function doesn't accrue interests even though the debt_token has outsanding debt

## Summary
- The global variable [`last_debt_update[_debt_token]` is set to be equals to the `block.timestamp`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-unstoppable/blob/main/unstoppable-dex-audit/contracts/margin-dex/Vault.vy#L1058) **before calling the [Vault::_debt_interest_since_last_update()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-unstoppable/blob/main/unstoppable-dex-audit/contracts/margin-dex/Vault.vy#L1069-L1076)**


## Vulnerability Detail
- In the Vault::_update_debt() function the variable [`last_debt_update[_debt_token]` is set to be equals to the `block.timestamp`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-unstoppable/blob/main/unstoppable-dex-audit/contracts/margin-dex/Vault.vy#L1058) right **before calling the [`Vault::_debt_interest_since_last_update()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-unstoppable/blob/main/unstoppable-dex-audit/contracts/margin-dex/Vault.vy#L1069-L1076)** where it is computed the interest to be accrued on the total debt of a specific token.
  - The problem is that when the logic of the function _debt_interest_since_last_update() is executed, [the value of the variable `self.last_debt_update[_debt_token]` has already been set to `block.timestamp` in the `_update_debt()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-unstoppable/blob/main/unstoppable-dex-audit/contracts/margin-dex/Vault.vy#L1058), and the [formula to compute the interest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-unstoppable/blob/main/unstoppable-dex-audit/contracts/margin-dex/Vault.vy#L1071-L1075) does a subtraction between the `block.timestamp - self.last_debt_update[_debt_token]`, but because `self.last_debt_update[_debt_token]` is equals to the `block.timestamp`, *such a subtraction will always be 0* (when called from the _update_debt()), **as a consequence, the computed & returned value will be 0 and no interests will be accrued even though there is debt**

## Impact
- Not accruing interests will cause that LPs don't get any benefit from putting their liquidity into the protocol, thus, LPs will most likely abstain from providing liquidity which will cause the Vault do not have enough liquidity to operate.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Make sure to update the value of the variable `self.last_debt_update[_debt_token]` **after** the `_debt_interest_since_last_update()` function has been executed & the interest on the outstanding debt has been accrued
- If there is no debt on the `debt_token`, update the `self.last_debt_update[]` before the function's execution is completed, this will help to correctly save in the contract's storage the fact that up to the current `block.timestamp` there was no debt for the debt_token
```solidity
def _update_debt(_debt_token: address):
    ***

-   self.last_debt_update[_debt_token] = block.timestamp
    
    if self.total_debt_amount[_debt_token] == 0:
+       self.last_debt_update[_debt_token] = block.timestamp    
        return # no debt, no interest

    self.total_debt_amount[_debt_token] += self._debt_interest_since_last_update(
        _debt_token
    )

+   self.last_debt_update[_debt_token] = block.timestamp
