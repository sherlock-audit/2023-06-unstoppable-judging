# Fee transfer should check that the amount is not 0

## Summary

When the searcher executes the order, the protocol transfers half of the fee to the searcher to motivate them, but the fee may be 0, but some tokens do not support transfer of zero-value tokens, which will cause the searcher to fail to execute the order without compensation.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    # allows searchers to execute for 50% of profits
    if _share_profit:
        profit: uint256 = amount_out - amount_minus_fee
        self._safe_transfer(order.token_out, msg.sender, profit/2)
```

`profit/2` may be 0, which be ignored

## Impact

For some tokens, if profit is 0, the searcher execute the order will revert.
