# Return values of `transfer()`/`transferFrom()` not checked

## Summary
Not all `ERC20` implementations `revert()` when there's a failure in `transfer()/transferFrom()`. The function signature has a `boolean` return value and they indicate errors that way instead. which should be checked else if they fail they will fail silently.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `TrailingStopDex.vy`
```vyper 
    ERC20(order.token_out).transfer(order.account, order.min_amount_out) # anything > min_amount_out stays in contract as profit
```
```vyper
    ERC20(order.token_in).transferFrom(order.account, self, order.amount_in)
```
```vyper
    ERC20(_token).transfer(self.owner, amount)
```
In `Dca.vy`
```vyper
     ERC20(_token).transfer(self.owner, amount)
```
In `SwapRouter.vy`
```vyper
       ERC20(_token_in).transferFrom(msg.sender, self, _amount_in)
```
## Impact
By not checking the return `value`, operations that should have marked as failed, may potentially go through without actually making a `payment`.

## Tool used

`Manual Review`

## Recommendation
Make sure to check the return `values` or better still, use `OpenZeppelinâ€™s` SafeERC20's` safeTransfer()`/`safeTransferFrom()`  Library instead although I'm not sure if it's available on `Vyper`
