# Oralce price should check freshness

## Summary

The oracle should check the timestamp threshold for freshness. When the oracle goes offline, the price is not updated, resulting in the use of outdated prices.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    # check current price
    current_price: uint256 = self._get_latest_oracle_price(oracle_address)

    # ensure current price < proof_round_price - trailing_percentage
    trigger_price: uint256 = proof_round_price * (100 - order.trailing_percentage) / 100 # TODO check
    assert current_price < trigger_price, "trigger price not reached"
```

The protocol will keep using the stale price as latest_oracle_price, the execution condition check of the user order is inaccurate.

## Impact

`_get_latest_oracle_price` may return stale current_price, searchers can utilize `stale current_price < trigger_price` to execute order, but the `actual price >= trigger_price`.
